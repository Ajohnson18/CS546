		<h1 class="title">The Time Alex Fought a Shark</h1>
		<title>This story is epic...</title>
		<p class="article-p">It all started only a couple months ago while Alex was working at a surf camp. It was a very foggy day and the setting was ominous. Early in the day Alex was fishing and had hooked up on a big fish but couldn't real it in. There was a suspition that the fish hooked was a shark but no one knew for sure. A lot of sharks had been spotted lately but none were that close to shore.</p>
		<p class="article-p">At around 10 in the morning the camp was running and the kids were in the water with instructors. All the kids were surfing well and the waves were fun for them but it was still overcast. Out of no where a massive fin came out of the water and started swimming at one of the instructors. Alex and the other manager grabbed surfboards and jumped on top of the shark scaring it away. All the kids were cleared from the water but it was one of the scariest experiences of his young life.</p>
